A cinema room manager program

About
Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre. In this project, I created an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more. This project is part of the kotlin basics course by JetBrain Academy
